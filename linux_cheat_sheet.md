## üí° Tips

- Use `&&` to run multiple commands in sequence:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Use | (pipe) to send output from one command to another:

bash
Copy code
ps aux | grep nginx
Use > to overwrite output into a file, >> to append:

bash
Copy code
echo "Backup complete" >> log.txt
Use tab completion to save time typing paths and commands.
